# Common Package

Lightweight shared utilities and constants consumed by multiple apps (frontend, api, hub).

## Contents

- Re-exported helpers from `index.ts`
- Cross-cutting pure functions (add here instead of duplicating)

## Usage

```ts
import { something } from "common";
```

## Future

- Add shared error types
- Shared validation schemas
