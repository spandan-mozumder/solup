# Turborepo starter

This Turborepo starter is maintained by the Turborepo core team.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```

## Browser-Based Validator

Validator activity now occurs only while a user has the `/validator` page open in the `frontend` app. There is no separate headless validator process.

### How It Works

1. User signs in.
2. Visits `/validator` and connects a Solana wallet.
3. Registers (POST `/api/validator`).
4. A browser runtime (`BrowserValidatorRuntime`) opens a WebSocket to the hub and performs validation tasks.
5. Closing the tab stops validation instantly (no background/headless continuation).

### Data Model

`Validator` fields: `publicKey`, `userId` (nullable, claimed on registration), `pendingPayouts`, `ip`, `location`.

### Hub Interaction

The hub (`apps/hub`) tracks currently connected validators (inâ€‘memory) and dispatches validation requests. Ticks recorded in `WebsiteTick` contribute to `pendingPayouts`.

### Environment Variables

Optional: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC` to override RPC endpoint.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Live tick/latency charts.
- Payout claiming UI.
- Support for multiple wallets per user (would require schema change removing unique on `userId`).
- WebSocket push for validator stats instead of polling `/stats`.
